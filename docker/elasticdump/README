This container aims to do daily backup of ES cluster
"The script" that cron calls is a python script, cos my bash scripting sucks.


env variables:
ELASTIC_HOST - default to http://elasticsearch:9200
RETENTION_PERIOD, default to 14 days

Image location: 
Pushed to dockdevx/custom_elasticdump:latest

requires the following in K8s:
mount a config variable as a file into /etc/environment looking like:
ELASTIC_HOST=xxx
RETENTION_PERIOD=7

this is because cron doesnt use the env variables, it's scope is more limited and so is unable to make use of environmental variables like normal containers
